We have been advising governments in South and Southeast Asia on appropriate public health responses to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Our analysis of the effects of lockdown policies for COVID-19 and optimal vaccine distribution plans is based on a networked, stochastic, compartmental epidemiological model. Additionally, economic effects of pandemic policies are analyzed via structural and synthetic methods. This work is a collaboration with Anup Malani (UChicago), Luis Bettencourt (UChicago), Clément Imbert (Warwick), Vaidehi Tandel (IDFC), Manoj Mohanan (Duke), Bhramar Mukherjee (UMichigan), Ashish Goel (Stanford), Jon Gruber (MIT), Devavrat Shah (MIT), Darius Lakdawalla (USC), Alice Chen (USC), and others.
