## Introduction

In 2010, the world reached a little-noticed tipping point: for the first time in recent history, more of the world's populations lived within urban areas rather than rural areas. Not only will this trend continue, it will _accelerate_, especially in areas like Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Of the rapidly urbanizing population, a significant portion are set to live in slums (or informal settlements), lacking infrastructure like power, clean water, sanitation, and paved roads. This work explores two questions: **what defines a slum?**, and **where are slums located?** We provide a infrastructure-focused definition independent of city shape and location, and apply this definition to OpenStreetMap data.

## Measuring Infrastructure Access: A Topological Approach
Many components of key infrastructure, especially sewage and power, are found along formal roads; roads also offer avenues to commerce and access to the rest of the urban fabric. When the road network cordons off land in urban areas, a city block is created. City blocks in advanced economies generally 

## Extracting and analyzing city blocks from OpenStreetMap

### parallelized processing of road networks and building footprints

### determining street block geometry

### approximating cadastral delineations

### creating topological graphs

## MillionNeighborhoods.org: A Global Map of Infrastructure Access

## Optimizing road access
Once the parts of a street block lacking access to the surrounding road network has have been identified, the natural follow-on question is: how can we connect these interior parcels to the formal roads? This process of topological optimization.
## Case studies: Kibera and Freetown
