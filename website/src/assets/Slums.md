## Introduction

In 2010, the world reached a little-noticed tipping point: from that year onwards, more of the world's populations lived within urban areas rather than rural areas. Not only will this trend continue, it will _accelerate_, especially in areas like Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Of the rapidly urbanizing population, a significant portion are set to live in slums (or informal settlements), lacking infrastructure like power, clean water, sanitation, and paved roads. This work explores two questions: what defines a slum, and where are slums located? We provide a infrastructure-focused definition independent of city shape and location, and apply this definition to OpenStreetMap data.
