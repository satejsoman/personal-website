## Stochastic Epidemiological Models
Compartmental epidemiological models have been used since the late 1920s to model pandemics, epidemics, and (presumably), other types of *demics. In these models, members of a population are split up into different _compartments_ based on their infection state. For example, a SIR model assigns each member of the population to either a <b>S</b>usceptible compartment of non-infected people, an <b>I</b>nfected component of everyone actively infected, and a <b>R</b>emoved compartment for everyone who either has Recovered or is now Resting in peace. Everyone starts in the Susceptible compartment, but people move into the Infected compartment as they contract the disease, and then finally move into the Removed compartment as they recover from or succumb to the disease.

The differential equations describing how the number of people in each of the compartments as a function of time are pretty well understood, and are characterized by a number of key parameters such as the <i>contact rate</i> (the average number of unique contacts per person per day) and the <i>generation interval</i> (how long the disease takes to generate symptoms after transmission), and so on and so forth. Issues with applying these models to Real World Messy Data include a) these parameters form a distribution that we can only approximate and b) the transitions of each member of the population from compartment to compartment are driven by stochastic, not deterministic, processes. We address these issues by discretizing the continuous-time differential equations and then treating the resulting discrete-time update step as the mean for a Poisson (minimum information) draw. This gives us a fully-specified distribution for the sizes of the compartments and the key parameters that we can update in a Bayesian manner when new data become available.
