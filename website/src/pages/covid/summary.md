We have been advising governments in South and Southeast Asia on appropriate public health responses to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Our analysis of the effects of lockdown policies for COVID-19 and optimal vaccine distribution plans is based on a networked and stochastic compartmental epidemiological model. Additionally, economic effects of pandemic policies are analyzed via structural and synthetic methods. This work is a collaboration with Anup Malani (UChicago), Luis Bettencourt (UChicago), Cl√©ment Imbert (Warwick), Vaidehi Tandel (IDFC), Manoj Mohanan (Duke), Bhramar Mukherjee (UMichigan), Ashish Goel (Stanford), Jon Gruber (MIT), Devavrat Shah (MIT), Darius Lakdawalla (USC), Alice Chen (USC), and others.
