We created a [global map of slums](https://www.millionneighborhoods.org) using an infrastructure-focused criterion for the informality of neighborhoods. Additionally, we propose methods for creating a cost-effective infrastructure upgrade plan for slums. This work was done with Luis Bettencourt, Anni Beukes, Nico Marchio, Cooper Nederhood, and Annie Yang (all at the University of Chicago's [Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation](https://miurban.uchicago.edu/)).
